# GradientDescentVisualization
A small program that creates an animation of a neural network "learning" how to classify two types of irises.

This is a heavily edited verison of a program I wrote for my AI class. A lot of the features that the class required have been removed, but a visualization has been added. An example can be found below.![image001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37251666/211674824-987a5ec2-d8c7-44a6-b179-0b42d8bf42ef.gif)
